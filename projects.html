					<h1>
						Designed entirely with Python. My asset visualizer allows the user to input assets with their ticker, share count, and cost basis to provide a total value based on the asset's up to date value.
						Individual assets can be further investigated with 1-year graphs visible alongside SMA20 and SMA50 indicators. Lots of other asset metrics are displayed below the graph such as Dividend, PE, PS, and a myriad of others.

					<h1>
						Within an interdisciplinary team, we performed a business consultation for a local agricultural startup called the Pacific American Foundation supported by NOAA Sea Grant: Hawaii.
						We researched local consumers, storefronts, and farmers markets. This culminated in a report of our findings and recomendations for the PAF's plan to bring a seaweed food product to their local market.
						This report was then published to the Digital WPI Library and NOAA Sea Grant of the University of Hawaii.

						This project was for the class CS3733 Software Engineering at WPI. This project was developed by myself and 3 other students collaborating from the initial designing using use cases, UML diagrams, and EBC diagrams to
						organize the project. This project was hosted by AWS which handled our backend in JS while front end was a ReactJS application. This project allowed for user creation as well as user generated content to be created
						stored in our database. This class was redesigned to include AWS to train students in a more modern fullstack to provide an application in the modern industry.
